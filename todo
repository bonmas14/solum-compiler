- pointer math or it wont work normally in interop/compile
- add globals! evaluate value by running through interpreter!
- constants

- allocators shouldn't be pointers!
- harmonize names
- create allocator functions that will check if pointer inside of theirs function
for debug purposes

- soft inlining - is when compiler generates output source code but inlines all of functions on source level. 
could be great for debug purposes?

X- fix the alignment and make structs alignment.
