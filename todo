- Rewrite parser to not use BNF-type logic to parse files. because it is too much of a code


- analyzer needs to make multiple global scopes for each imported file.
every file can be different executable.

- fix error when analyzer reports that variable doesn't have it's expression if there's only one.
This should not happen because one expression is set to multiple variables at the same time
